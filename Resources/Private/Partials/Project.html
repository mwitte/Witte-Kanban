<p>
	This project stated from a personal idea to learn something about TYPO3 Flow. The main goal for this project is
	self-improvement. Features are not important, but the technical quality is. Domain-driven design and test-driven
	development are patterns which the development of TYPO3 Flow followed. This project follows the same techniques.

<h4>v0.2</h4>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br/>
This version is incompatible to the previous. The major refactoring of the domain models to
get a future proof structure would require a huge migration. Because the previous version(v0.1) was no public release
this would be a waste of time.</p>
